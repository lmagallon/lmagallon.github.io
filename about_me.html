<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Leo Magallon and I teach math and physics at the 
STEM Academy of Boyle Heights in Los Angeles. I recently completed my 6th year of teaching. 
Last year, I taught one section of Intro to Engineering Design (IED).
I earned my Bachelors and Masters degrees from Occidental College as well as my single-subject teaching credential.</p>
